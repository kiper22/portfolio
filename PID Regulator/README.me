Pprogram is to simulate the operation of the motor with a pid controller on the selected microcontroller (at example Atmega64). The set speed should be entered, the current value should be displayed, overdrive should be signaled, and the I and D actions should be turned on and off. The windup phenomenon should be limited.


PINA - set speed
PORTB- current speed
PORTC- show distortion
PIND- turn on/off integral and derivative action
