# Video Voice Commander

VoiceCommander is a program designed to execute commands on a computer using voice recognition technology. Currently, the program allows users to adjust screen brightness and screen timeout, change the volume level, and launch applications using the 'start' command in Windows. The program is currently under development and additional features, such as text search on the screen, switching between open windows, and controlling music using VLC media player, are being added.
