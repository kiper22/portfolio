# Video Capture and Face Detection

This program is a starting point for a future engineering project. It captures video from a camera, takes pictures by pressing the spacebar, and allows switching between taken pictures using 'a' and 'd' keys, press 'backspace' to delate image. Additionally, it features face detection using Haar cascades by pressing the 'f' key.
