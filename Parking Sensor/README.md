# Parking Sensor
The project involved creating a parking sensor using a buzzer, LED strip, distance sensor, and an LCD screen. The LCD screen displayed the distance in the range of 0-150cm, and the 8 LED lights were programmed to light up in sequence as the distance decreased. If the distance was less than 90cm, one LED light would light up, and every 10cm, another LED light would be added. If the distance was less than 20cm, the buzzer would be activated.
