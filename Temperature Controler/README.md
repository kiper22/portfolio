# Temperature Controller

This program was written by two people to control an old heater used for drying filament for 3D printing. The code uses an Arduino board, a thermocouple sensor, and a liquid crystal display (LCD) to display the temperature and control the heater.

# Functionality

The program allows the user to set the temperature, heating time, and cooling time. It also displays the current temperature and the maximum temperature reached. The user can turn the heating on or off, and the program will automatically turn off the heater after the specified heating time has elapsed.
