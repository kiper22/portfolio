A simple program for reading books in PDF and EPUB formats. It has the ability to select a library path, search for books, and filter by extension.

I am currently working on adding audio capabilities for Polish and English. There are also improvements to modify the settings (resizing pages, adding full-screen mode, changing the number of pages displayed).

The libraries used are Tkinter, ttkbootstrap, fitz, ebooklib and beautifulsoup.
